# Open Adventures - Core Rules

This document covers the core rules for playing games of Open Adventures. In future the intention is to build upon these rules with new supplements and expansions that can add more complex features.

## 1 Characters

Every tabletop game requires characters to play as. Legendary heros, members of the city watch, undead hords, etc. In open adventures these characters are represented by a set of attributes, equipment and traits.

### The Dice Pool

A core mechanic of Open Adventures is the dice pool. A lot of games will have you perform 2 or 3 actions (such as move, fight, cast a spell, etc) each turn, but in Open Adventures these activities are instead dictated by how many dice you have in your pool.

Player characters will have a pool of 5 dice. Players can then assign those dice to their attributes to perform actions. The more dice you assign, the better the results of the action.

Dice from your dice pool are also used to defend against enemy attacks (using your defense attribute), so be carefull, using all your dice on your turn will leave you defenseless.

  **For example** A player decides to move their barbarian character and attack a skeleton warrior. The player assigns two of their dice to their "Move" attribute. Their Move attribute is 4, so the barbarian can move up to 8"/spaces (which allows him to reach the skeleton)

  The player then decides to perform a powerful attack on the skeleton. They assign two dice to their "Fight" attribute and roll those dice  to attack, a 2 and a 5. As the barbarian's Fight attribute is 3+ that means one dice is a hit. The player could spend their last dice on another attack, but instead they decide to keep their final dice in reserve (to try and protect against the skeleton's upcoming attack).

Finally, you **do not** need to pre-plan all your actions, dice can be assigned in any order on your turn. You could move once, then fight, then move again, etc.

### Attributes

All actions in the game are controlled by your characters "Attributes". Each character has the following attributes, that can be assigned dice from the players dice pool to perform these actions.

#### Move
The Move attribute is a fixed number (usually between 1 and 10) that shows how far the character a character will move, based on the dice assigned. A character with Move 4 can move up to 4"/spaces when a dice is assigned.

#### Fight
The Fight attribute is used when you perform a close combat attack. It will be a number between 2+ and 6+. This is the number you have to roll on any assigned dice to succeed at hitting an enemy.

#### Shoot
The Shoot attribute is used when you perform a ranged combat attack. For some characters (without ranged weapons) it will be blank. Otherwise it will be a number between 2+ and 6+. This is the number you have to roll on any assigned dice to succeed at shooting an enemy.

#### Skill
The Skill attribute is used when you perform skilled actions (such as picking locks, hacking computers, etc). It will usually be a number between 2+ and 6+. This is the number you have to roll on any assigned dice to succeed.

**NOTE** Very often, any check involving skill will involve passing more than one dice roll. These dice can be rolled simultaniously, or one after the other, BUT you cannot perform any other actions between dice rolls.

#### Mysticism
The Mysticism attribute is used when you perform a magical or mystical actions (most commonly casting spells). For some characters (without mystical inclanations) it will be blank. Otherwise it will be a number between 2+ and 6+. This is the number you have to roll on any assigned dice to succeed at performing a magical action.

You may also need to roll dice against your Mysticism attribute instead of Defence to defend against some magical attacks.

#### Defence
The Defence attribute is used when you need to defend against physical damage. It will be a number between 2+ and 6+. This is the number you have to roll on any dice you **DID NOT** assign on your turn. Each success will avoid a single point of damage.
