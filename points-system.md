# Creating characters

*note* this is still in development.

In order to create characters, you need to decide on what you would like the character to do and then assign them attributes.

These attributes can then be used to determine a points cost (provided later). 

To calculate the points cost, you need to  perform the following calculations:

## Movement

Each point in movement represents 1" of movement, for each dice assigned, the character can move this distance.

The maximum value for movement is 12", an average human would move at 4".

T calculate a points cost for movement, simply multiply the movement  value by 1.5 (rounding up).

## Melee

Melee starts at 6+ and represents what value needs to be rolled on each dice to be considered a "hit".

This stat can be modified to a minimum of 2+ (1 is always a fail).

Each reduction in value for melee is worth 2 points, For example, melee 5+ is worth 2 points, where as melee 2+ is worth 8 points.

## Shoot

Shoot starts at 6+ and represents what value needs to be rolled on each dice to be considered a "hit".

This stat can be modified to a minimum of 2+ (1 is always a fail).

Each reduction in value for melee is worth 3 points, For example, melee 5+ is worth 3 points, where as melee 2+ is worth 12 points.
