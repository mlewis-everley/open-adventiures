# Advanced Rules
Below are some advanced rule ideas. Each of these ideas is an optional rule that can be used to make the core rules a little more cinematic, complex or difficult.

## Hero Points
As well as the dice pool, each character can have a pre-determined number of "Hero Points" (3 is probably a good number). These points can be used to alter ANY dice roll involving your character either up or down.

## Bonus Dice
Each character can have a bonus dice that they roll alongside dice from their dice pool. This dice can result in an extra success and is great for representing extra heroic actions (such as those of super heros).

## 6's Explode
Every 6 rolled on a dice actually results in two successes. This can be great for representing amazing actions (such as scoring an awesome goal and showboating in a sports game)
